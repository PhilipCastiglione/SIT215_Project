# Notes

- python 3.7
- pip3 (comes with python)
- pipenv
- install deps with pipenv install
- or on windows install packages in pipfile individually
- to verify environment loaded correctly, run demo with `pipenv run python3 demo.py`
- run with `pipenv run python3 demo.py`
- interactive shell with deps using `pipenv shell`
- then you can use a python console
- on windows just python3 run.pu
